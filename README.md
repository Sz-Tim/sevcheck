### An R package of homemade functions I use a lot.

This is a package really just for my own use, though of course if by some insane chance anyone happens to come across it and thinks it's useful, I'd be happy if anyone else used it. It contains functions that I use frequently in various projects so I don't need to replicate the code in a bunch of different places.
